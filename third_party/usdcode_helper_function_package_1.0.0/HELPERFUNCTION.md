# USD Code Helper Function Package

Developers can access the Helper Function package directly by running the following script on their local machine.

First, download the wheel file, then install it with `usd-core`, `numpy` and `pillow`.

```bash
pip install usdcode-0.1.2-py3-none-any.whl "usd-core>=22.11" numpy==1.26.4 pillow==11.0.0
```

Check if the installation was successful. No output means the installation was successful.

```bash
python -c "import usdcode"
```
