``Isaac Lab Arena`` Documentation
=================================

``Isaac Lab Arena`` is an extension to `Isaac Lab <https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/index.html>`_.

Isaac Lab Arena is a comprehensive robotics simulation framework that enhances NVIDIA Isaac Lab by providing a composable,
scalable system for creating diverse simulation environments and evaluating robot learning policies.
The framework enables researchers and developers to rapidly prototype and test robotic tasks with various robot embodiments,
objects, and environments.

   IsaacLab Arena Workflow Overview


The key components of the workflow are:

- **Scene Setup**: Define the scene layout, add asset configurations to interact with objects in interest in the scene. See :doc:`pages/concepts/concept_scene_design` for more details.
- **Embodiment Setup**: Define the robot embodiment, its observations, actions, sensors etc. See :doc:`pages/concepts/concept_embodiment_design` for more details.
- **Task Setup**: Define the task and its metrics. See :doc:`pages/concepts/concept_tasks_design` for more details.
- **Affordance Setup**: Define the affordances(interactable objects) and their interactions. See :doc:`pages/concepts/concept_affordances_design` for more details.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the policy and its performance in a simple and straightforward manner. See :doc:`pages/concepts/concept_metrics_design` for more details.

A key feature of ``Isaac Lab Arena`` is an easier, more composable interface for creating environments.

The following code snippet shows a simple example(open a microwave door) of how to setup a manager based RL environment using ``isaaclab_arena``.

.. code-block:: python

   embodiment = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name(args_cli.embodiment)(enable_cameras=args_cli.enable_cameras) # This will pull the GR1T2 embodiment with cameras enabled.
   background = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name("kitchen")() # This will pull the kitchen background.
   microwave = asset_registry.get_asset_by_name("microwave")() # This will pull the microwave object.

   # Compose the scene
   scene = Scene([background, microwave]) # This will compose a scene with the background and microwave and register the microwave as an affordance.

   isaac_arena_environment = IsaacArenaEnvironment(
      name="gr1_open_microwave",
      embodiment=embodiment,
      scene=scene,
      task=OpenDoorTask(microwave, openness_threshold=0.8, reset_openness=0.2),
      teleop_device=teleop_device,
   )

   env_builder = ArenaEnvBuilder(isaac_arena_environment, args_cli)
   env = env_builder.make_registered() # This will register the environment with the gym registry.
